<font size="4"><p>A couple of days ago, a friend and I were walking around the world looking for an abandoned mine. We wanted to find a couple of records, especially the "13" record. Suddenly I noticed a small hole in the ground, it turned out to be a descent into the cave. We started to go down, we met monsters along the way, but we had pretty good equipment, so zombies, spiders, or skeletons were not a threat to us. Going down to the level of about 15, in the distance I saw a long tunnel and a small light that came from its depth. This is what we spent a lot of time for. In total, we were in the mine for 20 minutes, unfortunately we could not find any records. Disappointed, we went to find a way out of this place. When I turned the corner, in the distance of the tunnel I saw a sign, initially I thought that it seems to me, but it was not there... going To the sign, I read on it the inscription: "Hello! My name is Billy! Let's be friends?". I thought it was funny, because I was sure that Eren (my friend) had left this sign. He just joked with me when I asked him this, he did not answer... as it turned out, I lost the Internet on my computer, but I was still on the server, although I was not the host. Back in the game, I ran to look for a way out, good I found it. I checked the list of players, but there was no one else on the server except me... I felt uneasy. When I went upstairs, I was horrified ... in the Distance, on a small hill, there was a strange figure, it had a completely white skin, except for a terribly smiling face... This strange creature wrote in the chat:<br><br>"Billy" - hi, my name is Billy!

"Billy" - Let's be friends?<br><br> Most of the times, he stalks you from long distances and hides in corners of the screen. However, you could have a bad day. This "bad day" would mean that Billy has decided to have enough and<br> say "W E W I L L B E F R I E N D S" over and over again and kills you. He will crash your game and you will be unlikely to never see him again. His true intent is<br> unknown but all he does is strikes you whenever he is bored.</font>
